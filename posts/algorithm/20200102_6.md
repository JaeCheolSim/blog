앞 전 문제와 비슷하지만 이번엔 경우의수를 구해보는 문제.

# 문제

You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Note: Given n will be a positive integer.

Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.

1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
   Example 2:

Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.

1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

## 생각의 흐름

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var climbStairs = function(n) {
	const dp = [];
	for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
		if (i <= 2) {
			dp[i] = i;
		} else {
			dp[i] = dp[i - 2] + dp[i - 1];
		}
	}
	return dp[n];
};
```
